## 1.3 NodeJS Posting

This first coding assessment tests:

1. Understand and refactor callback-based asynchronous code.
2. Create and use Promises.
3. Chain Promises uses the .then() method.
4. Handle errors in a Promise chain (if they implement the bonus task).

### To evaluate your solution, you should look for:

- [x] Proper conversation of callback-based functions to Promise-based functions.
- [x] Correct use of Promise chaining with the .then() methods.
- [x] Logical flow of data through the Promise chain.
- [x] Error handling implementation (for bonus points).
